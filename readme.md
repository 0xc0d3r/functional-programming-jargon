# Functional Programming Jargons

> The whole idea of this repos is to try and define jargons from combinatorics and category theory jargons that are used in functional programming in a easier fashion.

__Let's try and define these with examples, this is a WIP please feel free to send PR ;)__


## Arity

> The number of arguments a function takes.

```js
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

const arity = sum.length;
console.log(arity);
// => 2
// The arity of sum is 2
```
